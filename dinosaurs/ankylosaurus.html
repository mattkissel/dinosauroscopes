    <h2>Yearly Omikuji Fortune</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Overall Luck</dt>
      <dd>吉 (Good Luck): You cruise through the year mostly unscathed—except for one incident involving rogue fruit and a dramatic tail spin. Recovery: immediate. Dignity: intact.</dd>

      <dt>Love</dt>
      <dd>A calm admirer who respects quiet snacks and strong boundaries begins delivering leaves at respectful distances. You allow closer proximity by midsummer. That’s basically dating.</dd>

      <dt>The Person You're Waiting For</dt>
      <dd>A wandering artist who once sketched you without asking returns to apologize and offer a moss portrait. It’s weirdly good. You feel seen—through armor and all.</dd>

      <dt>Lost Item</dt>
      <dd>Your favorite backplate polishing pebble, long missing, is found glued to someone’s ceremonial headgear. They claim it’s a relic. You reclaim it with minimal violence. They thank you.</dd>

      <dt>Studies and Learning</dt>
      <dd>You absorb knowledge slowly but deeply. A surprising affinity for rhythm-based mnemonic chants awakens during a study circle. You become the group’s emotional metronome.</dd>

      <dt>Work and Projects</dt>
      <dd>Your consistency earns a promotion to “Obstacle Coordinator.” You block things. You move things. You resolve conflicts by gently being immovable. Herd morale skyrockets.</dd>

      <dt>Taking a Trip</dt>
      <dd>A journey across volcanic terrain reveals your inner heat-proof confidence. One dramatic selfie near a lava bubble goes viral among herbivores. You gain mild celebrity status.</dd>

      <dt>Wish</dt>
      <dd>You wish for tranquility. You receive a moss-covered cave with temperature-controlled puddles and echo acoustics. Your snacking sounds become soothing ambiance.</dd>

      <dt>Health</dt>
      <dd>Your armor remains flawless. Your joints whisper occasionally. A mix of leaf yoga and tail stretches resolves everything. Optional bonus: improved swagger stride.</dd>
