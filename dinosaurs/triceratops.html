    <h2>Yearly Omikuji Fortune</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Overall Luck</dt>
      <dd>中吉 (Middle Blessing): You’ll navigate the year like a diplomatic tank—gracefully armored, occasionally snack-fueled, always respected. Just avoid headbutting conversations about feelings.</dd>

      <dt>Love</dt>
      <dd>Someone with nervous charm and big ideas tries to impress you by offering their entire fern stash. You accept one frond. The romance begins, slowly and with leafy trust.</dd>

      <dt>The Person You're Waiting For</dt>
      <dd>A stubborn wanderer who appreciates boundaries and dramatic sunsets finally builds the courage to honk gently at you during a migration rest stop. It’s weirdly touching.</dd>

      <dt>Lost Item</dt>
      <dd>Your ceremonial forehead polish sponge, once thought stolen by a juvenile Velociraptor, turns up inside your own horn cap. You laugh. Quietly. Alone. With pride.</dd>

      <dt>Studies and Learning</dt>
      <dd>Classroom dynamics frustrate you until someone invents “field brawls” as study reinforcement. You become valedictorian of the head-based curriculum. No one questions your GPA ever again.</dd>

      <dt>Work and Projects</dt>
      <dd>You’re assigned “logistics,” but everyone knows you’re secretly HR. Your ability to detect lies and offer moral support while chewing grass earns a statue made of sticks.</dd>

      <dt>Taking a Trip</dt>
      <dd>A trip planned by someone less cautious than you turns magical when you discover a hollow log that echoes compliments. You camp there. You thrive. You may never leave.</dd>

      <dt>Wish</dt>
      <dd>You wish for stability—but the universe sends emotional vulnerability wrapped in a vine hammock. Turns out: it’s exactly what you needed. You adjust horn angles to express acceptance.</dd>

      <dt>Health</dt>
      <dd>Your stress resides mainly in your shoulders and left horn. Daily stretching and occasional wall-scuffing rituals keep your aura grounded and your enemies mildly concerned.</dd>
