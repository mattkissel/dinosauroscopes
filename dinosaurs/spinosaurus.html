  <h2>Yearly Omikuji Fortune</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Overall Luck</dt>
    <dd>中吉 (Middle Blessing): Your tides rise and fall—this year brings medium-size glory with a splash of public embarrassment. Waterproof your ego early.</dd>

    <dt>Love</dt>
    <dd>A fellow aquatic enthusiast will challenge you to a splash duel. You lose. That’s how you fall in love. It’s wet, messy, and deeply fulfilling.</dd>

    <dt>The Person You're Waiting For</dt>
    <dd>A mud-covered wanderer who once mocked your sail will resurface, now deeply intrigued by your tail. Their idea of flirting involves throwing moss. Receive it graciously.</dd>

    <dt>Lost Item</dt>
    <dd>Your waterproof sketchbook containing personal doodles and travel maps floats back to shore wrapped in kelp. Somehow, it’s now trending in three herds.</dd>

    <dt>Studies and Learning</dt>
    <dd>You sign up for a cave-based lecture series but ditch it halfway to explore the lagoon. You end up writing your own syllabus based on bubbles, intuition, and fish migration. It works.</dd>

    <dt>Work and Projects</dt>
    <dd>Your solo hunting blog gains unexpected traction. Unfortunately, it draws sponsorships from fish you consider food. You sell out briefly. Then eat the contracts.</dd>

    <dt>Taking a Trip</dt>
    <dd>An ambitious swim upriver leads to a social gathering of scale-polishers and bone collectors. You steal the show by pretending not to care, then doing a tailbackflip.</dd>

    <dt>Wish</dt>
    <dd>Your wish to be taken seriously comes half true—herbivores approach you for leadership, but only in the water. You become Marsh Lord by autumn. Ceremonial algae crown included.</dd>

    <dt>Health</dt>
    <dd>Your dorsal sail reacts to emotional stress by glowing slightly—probably not medical. Just avoid direct sunlight during existential crises. Float often, bite less.</dd>
