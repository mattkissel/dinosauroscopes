  <h2>Yearly Omikuji Fortune</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Overall Luck</dt>
    <dd>大吉 (Great Blessing): Your feathered fortune spreads far and wide. Expect dramatic entrances, stylish exits, and at least three unintentional admirers who think you invented flight.</dd>

    <dt>Love</dt>
    <dd>Someone with questionable plumage and excellent timing will try to impress you via midair snack deliveries. Accept one, but critique their wing posture for dominance.</dd>

    <dt>The Person You're Waiting For</dt>
    <dd>A stargazing loner who writes cave haikus and folds leaves into hearts finally lands beside you during a windy dusk. You feel seen. Also slightly flattered. Possibly endangered.</dd>

    <dt>Lost Item</dt>
    <dd>Your favorite shiny beetle carcass, previously assumed stolen, is actually stuck between your tail feathers. It’s fossilizing nicely. Keep it—it’s trending.</dd>

    <dt>Studies and Learning</dt>
    <dd>You understand theory by reenacting it upside down from branches. Eventually, someone notices and declares you a thought leader. You nod sagely while nibbling a pinecone.</dd>

    <dt>Work and Projects</dt>
    <dd>You begin leading aerial scouting missions. No one understands the maps you draw with claw gestures, but everyone agrees they look majestic and imply success.</dd>

    <dt>Taking a Trip</dt>
    <dd>A spontaneous glide into unknown skies brings new friends and one awkward mid-air collision with a flirtatious Pterosaur. You recover gracefully and never speak of it again.</dd>

    <dt>Wish</dt>
    <dd>You wish for a peaceful perch. What you receive: a cliffside crevice with great acoustics, unpredictable breezes, and a fan club of ants who applaud your nesting style.</dd>

    <dt>Health</dt>
    <dd>Your wings thrive on dramatic gestures. Stretch often, preen responsibly, and avoid nesting near noisy volcanoes. Molting is inevitable—do it with flair and backup vocals.</dd>
