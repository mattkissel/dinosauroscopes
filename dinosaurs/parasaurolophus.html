  <h2>Yearly Omikuji Fortune</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Overall Luck</dt>
    <dd>大吉 (Great Blessing): This is your symphonic year—everything harmonizes with minimal chaos, as long as you don’t lose your crest in a high-five accident.</dd>

    <dt>Love</dt>
    <dd>A sweet soul who thinks in poems will resonate with you—literally. You’ll hear their footsteps like a familiar call, and realize you’ve been dancing to the same emotional rhythm all along.</dd>

    <dt>The Person You're Waiting For</dt>
    <dd>Someone who once heard your mating trumpet and mistook it for a weather report will come back with snacks and better listening skills. This time, they stay.</dd>

    <dt>Lost Item</dt>
    <dd>A hand-carved ocarina made from fossilized bark reappears—inside a puddle. It still plays. Ghosts may sing backup.</dd>

    <dt>Studies and Learning</dt>
    <dd>Your best ideas arrive while floating in a pond. Unfortunately, your study group may be allergic to moisture and metaphors. Choose hydration over consensus.</dd>

    <dt>Work and Projects</dt>
    <dd>A colleague makes a loud entrance, then vanishes—leaving you in charge of the seasonal migration schedule. Everyone is grateful. You get an edible wreath and a promotion that smells like mint.</dd>

    <dt>Taking a Trip</dt>
    <dd>Your peaceful journey will accidentally become a musical tour when your echoing calls attract forest audiences. Perform once. Then flee dramatically into a ravine to preserve your mystique.</dd>

    <dt>Wish</dt>
    <dd>You wish for clarity—but receive a hauntingly beautiful mystery instead. Spoiler: it's better than clarity. Clarity never brings handmade moss poetry.</dd>

    <dt>Health</dt>
    <dd>Your crest hums when dehydrated. Everyone notices. You start a hydration trend across four herds and become an influencer. Drink responsibly and accept your destiny.</dd>
