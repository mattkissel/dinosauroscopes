  <h2>Yearly Omikuji Fortune</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Overall Luck</dt>
    <dd>末吉 (Near Blessing): You’ll graze through the year avoiding most stampedes, but your massive chill may be mistaken for emotional distance. Don’t let your zen be misinterpreted.</dd>

    <dt>Love</dt>
    <dd>Someone patient and moss-scented has been quietly orbiting your tail for months. If you move slightly to the left, you’ll accidentally initiate an emotional hug.</dd>

    <dt>The Person You're Waiting For</dt>
    <dd>A soft-spoken wanderer with an appreciation for big bones and subtle glances finally circles back after a long migration. They’re carrying snacks and three compliments.</dd>

    <dt>Lost Item</dt>
    <dd>Your carved walking pebble resurfaces under a pile of mulch. It’s smoother now. Possibly wiser. May whisper advice if held correctly during a full moon.</dd>

    <dt>Studies and Learning</dt>
    <dd>You learn best lying down, which confuses your instructor. Your slow-paced method leads to enlightenment, especially if the curriculum includes rocks or clouds.</dd>

    <dt>Work and Projects</dt>
    <dd>You’ll be entrusted with transporting heavy emotional baggage (and actual supplies). Your calm efficiency wins admiration and unsolicited massage offers.</dd>

    <dt>Taking a Trip</dt>
    <dd>A relaxing journey to a muddy basin may result in the discovery of a forgotten talent: underwater ballet. You perform once. No one films it. That's probably for the best.</dd>

    <dt>Wish</dt>
    <dd>You wish for peace and stillness—but receive spontaneous group admiration after accidentally becoming the subject of a cave mural. You are now art.</dd>

    <dt>Health</dt>
    <dd>Your tail has been holding tension since the Cretaceous. A gentle stretch and a long sigh near running water will restore balance and possibly attract romantics with neck envy.</dd>
