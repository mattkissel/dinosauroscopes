  <h2>Yearly Omikuji Fortune</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Overall Luck</dt>
    <dd>中吉 (Middle Blessing): Leadership opportunities fall into your claws. Just don't challenge a Stegosaurus to a debate—they fight with silence and spikes.</dd>

    <dt>Love</dt>
    <dd>You’ll attract admirers who mistake your confidence for flirtation. One of them bites back—in a good way. Tail fencing may become foreplay.</dd>

    <dt>The Person You're Waiting For</dt>
    <dd>A chaotic strategist with a soft heart and a tendency to leap before roaring. They once rolled their eyes at your display call. They were secretly impressed.</dd>

    <dt>Lost Item</dt>
    <dd>Your favorite claw-polish stone shows up inside someone else's nest. That someone denies everything while clearly using it. You can reclaim it diplomatically—or bite them.</dd>

    <dt>Studies and Learning</dt>
    <dd>You’ll discover that you learn best mid-chase. Sign up for any workshop that includes running, roaring, or sparring. Traditional classrooms bore you into a nap.</dd>

    <dt>Work and Projects</dt>
    <dd>A rival tries to outshine you by shouting louder. You respond with a perfectly executed ambush presentation that leaves the herd stunned and applause echoing off the cliff walls.</dd>

    <dt>Taking a Trip</dt>
    <dd>You’ll volunteer to escort a smaller dinosaur across unfamiliar terrain. You bond over snack-sharing and mutual distrust of pterosaurs. This trip changes you—slightly. Emotionally. Maybe.</dd>

    <dt>Wish</dt>
    <dd>Your desire for status will manifest as recognition—but not the kind you expected. You're declared honorary "Mud King" during rainy migration. It's less regal, more beloved.</dd>

    <dt>Health</dt>
    <dd>Your roar muscles get overused during mating season. Consider crooning instead of yelling. Unexpected bonus: improves your vocal range and creates a niche dating market.</dd>
