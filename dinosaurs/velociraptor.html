  <h2>Yearly Omikuji Fortune</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Overall Luck</dt>
    <dd>中吉 (Middle Blessing): You’ll dodge most disasters with clever footwork—but may sprint directly into drama if someone questions your hunting playlist.</dd>

    <dt>Love</dt>
    <dd>You're fast, you're flashy, you're emotionally unavailable until someone matches your snark in a chance encounter near a collapsed log. Sparks will fly, claws may flex.</dd>

    <dt>The Person You're Waiting For</dt>
    <dd>A slippery extrovert who always wins footraces—but loses at introspection—will finally admit they've been circling you for months. You knew. You were just playing the long game.</dd>

    <dt>Lost Item</dt>
    <dd>You’ll recover your lucky claw necklace from the mud under someone else’s nest. It still smells like betrayal, but it glows faintly when danger’s near. Useful.</dd>

    <dt>Studies and Learning</dt>
    <dd>You will pretend to attend lectures while secretly speed-mapping alternative trails. This pays off when the real test involves outflanking a T. rex-themed obstacle course.</dd>

    <dt>Work and Projects</dt>
    <dd>A leadership opportunity appears when everyone else panics at a loud noise. Your confident shriek during chaos earns respect and possibly a corner nest office.</dd>

    <dt>Taking a Trip</dt>
    <dd>You’ll take an impulsive solo sprint into an unknown canyon. You find a pile of glittering fossils and absolutely zero cell reception. It’s glorious.</dd>

    <dt>Wish</dt>
    <dd>The thing you’ve been craving—speed, attention, a better crunch sound—comes true in the form of a stealth upgrade to your toe claws. You won’t admit how proud you are. But you flex them a lot.</dd>

    <dt>Health</dt>
    <dd>Your knee joints creak every time you lie. Consider stretches, hydration, or more honesty. Tail-twitch fatigue may be real, but tail appreciation is on the rise.</dd>
