  <h2>Yearly Omikuji Fortune</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Overall Luck</dt>
    <dd>小吉 (Small Blessing): The universe tosses you some good headwinds—but only if you occasionally stop charging things emotionally. Reflect, then headbutt selectively.</dd>

    <dt>Love</dt>
    <dd>Someone attempts to flirt via frontal collision. You mistake it for a challenge and knock them into a bush. Shockingly, they are impressed. Romantically bruised, emotionally intrigued.</dd>

    <dt>The Person You're Waiting For</dt>
    <dd>A fellow wall-watcher emerges mid-year, quoting cryptic riddles and wearing a shell necklace. They may be weird. They may be perfect. Either way, your skull tingles near them.</dd>

    <dt>Lost Item</dt>
    <dd>Your ceremonial head-polish rock returns after someone uses it for soup grinding. It smells spicy, looks shinier, and triggers vivid memories of last year's arguments.</dd>

    <dt>Studies and Learning</dt>
    <dd>You study in short bursts—between impact sprints. Surprisingly, this method makes you excellent at interpreting metaphors, cave poetry, and passive-aggressive leaf markings.</dd>

    <dt>Work and Projects</dt>
    <dd>You get assigned a “support” role but redefine it as “emotional demolition specialist.” Your unique conflict resolution style results in workplace silence and respect.</dd>

    <dt>Taking a Trip</dt>
    <dd>A long walk through rocky terrain leads you to an abandoned amphitheater. You give an impromptu speech on inner resilience. Three lizards join your cult. You’re flattered, not responsible.</dd>

    <dt>Wish</dt>
    <dd>You wish for clarity—and receive a dream about a spiraling horn and a pond that hums. It makes zero sense, but you wake up calm and vaguely enlightened.</dd>

    <dt>Health</dt>
    <dd>Minor skull rumbles suggest you should ease up on wall-greetings. Try leaf breathing, gentle charging, or long staring contests with waterfalls.</dd>
