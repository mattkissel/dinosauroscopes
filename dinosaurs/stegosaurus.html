  <h2>Yearly Omikuji Fortune</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Overall Luck</dt>
    <dd>小吉 (Small Blessing): Your spiked serenity will protect you from most disasters—except emotional turbulence caused by someone rearranging your fern collection.</dd>

    <dt>Love</dt>
    <dd>Someone with a healthy appreciation for moss and thick necks notices you during a stampede escape drill. Do not flee—this could be love. Or mutual survival instincts.</dd>

    <dt>The Person You're Waiting For</dt>
    <dd>A contemplative soul wearing mismatched scales who often hums to themselves. They once loaned you a rock and called it a love token. It finally makes sense this year.</dd>

    <dt>A Thing You Have Lost</dt>
    <dd>Your favorite flat stone with fossilized snack residue is rediscovered when someone mistakes it for a coaster. It now has sentimental AND beverage-resistant value.</dd>

    <dt>Studies and Learning</dt>
    <dd>You’ll read six chapters on prehistoric horticulture and forget them all—until a ghostly fern appears in a dream to re-teach the material. Trust your subconscious shrubbery.</dd>

    <dt>Work and Projects</dt>
    <dd>An irritating Troodon tries to delegate everything to you. One gentle tail-thwack later, you’re promoted to lead plant analyst. Office herbivores rejoice.</dd>

    <dt>Taking a Trip</dt>
    <dd>You’re invited on a group migration but consider declining due to your aversion to hill climbing. Say yes—the view from the top reveals a romantic sub-plot and free snacks.</dd>

    <dt>Something You’re Wishing For</dt>
    <dd>Your desire for peace and shade comes true when someone builds you a leaf hut. You live there now. There are little windchimes made of teeth. It's perfect.</dd>

    <dt>Your Health</dt>
    <dd>Your backplates are unusually expressive this year. If one tingles unexpectedly, it might be a weather warning. If they all tingle—run, dance, or consult a Pterosaur physician.</dd>
