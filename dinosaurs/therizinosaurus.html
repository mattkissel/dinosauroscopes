  <h2>Yearly Omikuji Fortune</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Overall Luck</dt>
    <dd>末吉 (Near Blessing): The shadows favor you, but only if you remain vague. Expect moderate success with dramatic lighting. Unusual encounters may involve birds that know your name.</dd>

    <dt>Love</dt>
    <dd>A quiet admirer who watches from behind ferns finally speaks—mid sneeze. You respond by offering a talon. They accept. You’ll never discuss feelings, but you’ll both know.</dd>

    <dt>The Person You're Waiting For</dt>
    <dd>A nocturnal poet with moss tattoos and an affinity for weird vegetables approaches slowly. They gift you a pinecone wrapped in silk. Interpretation is optional. Love is probable.</dd>

    <dt>Lost Item</dt>
    <dd>Your scented claw-wrap, missing since the last solstice, reappears covered in mysterious symbols. You wear it again. The forest applauds silently.</dd>

    <dt>Studies and Learning</dt>
    <dd>You’ll accidentally become the emotional tutor for a confused herbivore. Your teaching method involves staring and cryptic humming. They flourish. You remain uncredited. It's fine.</dd>

    <dt>Work and Projects</dt>
    <dd>A confusing task is given to you “because you look like you understand mysteries.” You do. You complete it beautifully. No one knows how. Everyone applauds anyway.</dd>

    <dt>Taking a Trip</dt>
    <dd>A journey into misty wetlands results in a personal revelation and one haunted rock. You now identify as “emotionally semi-aquatic.” It’s a phase. Or a brand.</dd>

    <dt>Wish</dt>
    <dd>You wish for deeper connection. You get a cryptic conversation with a reflective puddle and a brief hand-holding session with someone who thinks you're a ghost. Emotionally satisfying.</dd>

    <dt>Health</dt>
    <dd>Your claws ache from over-expression. Apply leaf salves and reduce dramatic gestures by 12%. Consider lounging in fog—your skin loves it, and it complements your vibe.</dd>
